# Designing-Login-page


This a design of Login page and Signup build using HTML and CSS.

There is no javascript used in it because it is just a designing page.

If you require the login page to be functional and login by check the database and the data by signup , you can check my another repository called [Login](https://github.com/MADESH-KUMAR-M/Login).
This repository use MqSQL and PHP to Signup and Login by creating the database in MySQL with the same design used here.
